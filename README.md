# <Weather-App>

## Description


My motivation to build this was to help people get the weather update and stay up to date with conditions.
I built this project so people can have a simple weather app to check the current weather and the forecast.
This solves the problem of needing information about the weather and not having it easily accessible.
I learned how to use outside apis data to use in my application.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this application, first search for the city you want the weather for and once you click find city, information about the current weather and 5 day forecast will display on the screen.
